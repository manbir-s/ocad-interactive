	<h2>What do you think is Lialina’s opinion of the word “user”?</h2>

	<p>Lialina says that replacing the word user for people can be dangerous as it “hides the existence of two classes of people — developers and users.”. If the word users is to be replaced by people, users may lose their rights. Don Norman wants to eliminate the word user and replace it with the word people as he wants to make interaction seem invisible, as they are trying to make computers invisible. Lialina’s opinion is the opposite as she says that the word “user” is the last reminder we have that we’re using a computer.</p>

	<h2>What is Lialina’s ideal internet user? Provide some of the qualities that she outlines.</h2>

	<p>Lialina’s ideal internet user is “The General Purpose User/Universal Users/Turing Complete Users. Lialina says that these users “have the ability to achieve their goals regardless of the primary purpose of an application or device. Such users will find a way to their aspiration without an app or utility programmed specifically for it.”. She gives examples of what a Universal User is, “General Purpose Users can write an article in their e-mail client, layout their business card in Excel and shave in front of a web cam. They can also find a way to publish photos online without flickr, tweet without twitter, like without facebook, make a black frame around pictures without instagram, remove a black frame from an instagram picture and even wake up at 7:00 without a “wake up at 7:00” app.”.</p>

	<h2>From your own experiences interacting on the web—what is an example where there are “gaps that can be filled by users”?</h2>

	<p>An example where there are “gaps that can be filled by users” are social media websites. Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and such have a code of displaying posts and have algorithms of what related posts to show and when to show them and codes for “liking” and “reposting” content. The gaps that users fill are by posting content themselves, “where smoothness and seamlessness are broken and some of the final links in the chain are left for the users to complete.”.</p>
