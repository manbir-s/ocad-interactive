			<spanp1>Everyone <spanstrike>knows</spanstrike> that a censorship system <spanstrike>exists</spanstrike> in certain countries,
					but there is very little discussion of <spanstrike>why</spanstrike> it exists.
					<br>
					<br>
					At first glance, the censorship seems <spanstrike>invisible</spanstrike>, but it’s omnipresent <spanstrike>washing</spanstrike> of people’s feelings and perceptions creates <spanstrike>limits</spanstrike> on the
					<spanstrike>information</spanstrike> people receive, select and rely upon.</spanp1>

			<h1 id="section-two">WHAT IS CENSORSHIP?</h1>
			<spanp2>“Censorship, the changing or the suppression or prohibition
					of speech or writing that is deemed subversive of
					the common good. It occurs in all manifestations of authority
					to some degree, but in modern times it has been
					of special importance in its relation to government and
					the rule of law.”</spanp2>
			
			<h1 id="section-three">ABOUT US</h1>

			<spanp4>Forbidden Freedom is an organization that spreads awareness about the affects and consequences of censorship. This organization helps reach out the those who need a voice in their community but are unable to because of censorship reasons.</spanp4>
			
			<h1 id="section-four">POP UP EVENT</h1>
			<spanh4>Nathan Phillips Square<br>
					April 17th - 26th, 2020<br>
					10 A.M. to 7 P.M.</spanh4>

			<spanp5>The pop-up will be located at Nathan
					Phillips Square on April 17th - 26th, 2020
					from 10 A.M. to 7 P.M. The event will
					spread awareness of affects of censorship.
					<br>
					<br>
					The walls are pixelated glass so people
					from outside cannot see what is on display
					inside. There are black bars on the
					outside of the event to symbolize censorsed
					words. The event is setup in a L
					shape format for people to walk
					through. As people walk through, they
					will see posters of the event, data visualization
					of consequences of breaking
					censorship rules, a map of the world
					that shows which country has the most
					censorship and ending off with a blackboard
					where people can write whatever
					they would like.</spanp5>
